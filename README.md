# Driver Distraction Detection using MediaPipe and Machine Learning
This project aims to detect driver distraction using real-time video input by leveraging "MediaPipe" for face and hand tracking, along with machine learning algorithms. The system identifies actions such as looking away, or drowsiness based on facial landmarks and hand positions. "MediaPipe" extracts key landmarks, while a trained machine learning model classifies these features to detect distracted behavior. The model is designed to provide alerts in case of distraction, improving driver safety. This implementation is lightweight, fast, and suitable for edge devices.
